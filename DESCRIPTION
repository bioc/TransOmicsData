Description: Contains a collection of trans-omics datasets generated using various sequencing technologies such as RNA-seq, Mass spectrometry and ChIP-seq.
    Modalities include the bulk profiling of the phosphoproteome, proteome, transcriptome and epigenome.
    Data reflects the timecourses of different developmental systems from the mouse or human.
